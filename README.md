# SpOC 3: Orbital Megastructures 

The year is 2287 and you wander through the tunnels of Lunar
City. Passing by you favorite kiosk, which is the only one on the Moon
that still sells newspapers made out of *real* paper, an article
in *The Earth Observer* catches your eyes. You grab a copy and a cup of
100% Quetelet-Crate-Bean coffee.

### Torso Decompositions

Before we can start designing astonishing megastructures in the GRAIL
or OASIS project, we need to arrange the building blocks
suitably. These blocks, called nodes or vertices, are bound to
specific pairwise interactions. Some blocks clearly belong to the same
part of the megastructure, while others share no interaction. For an
effective and energy-efficient structure setup, it is critical to
identify an ordering of the nodes that indicates parts of the structure that can be
assembled concurrently, and that encodes a global blueprint for recursively
constructing the megastructure. At the Graph Reduction Algorithm for
Planetary-scale Hyper-optimisation (GRAPH) meta-project, we develop
the toolkit for exactly this task -- and we hope that engaged scientists and
engineers like you will help us to complete the project in time!
